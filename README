Apache-BabyConnect version 0.93
===============================

The previous version 0.92 is missing many files and instructions on
how to use the Apache::BabyConnect. That version was my first module
to upload to CPAN and it has many bugs. Use version 0.93 instead.

Apache::BabyConnect version 0.93 is stable and has been tested on
Linux Fedora.
